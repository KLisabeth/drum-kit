> A static web page built with only HTML, CSS & JavaScript. This project uses .wav audio files and keypress events to turn the user's keyboard into a drum set.

> Studying this project we learned about:

* Using the <audio> tag and .wav assets
* How the query selector can be used to easily interact with many elements

> This code was well organized before `development-strategy`!
